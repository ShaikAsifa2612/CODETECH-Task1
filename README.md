# Overview of the project:
### project: Boston Housing prices-Linear Regression analysis
### Overview of the project:

The Boston Housing prices Linear Regression project aims to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston using various features from the dataset, such as crime rate, number of rooms, and distance to employment centers. The process involves exploratory data analysis to understand the data and its relationships, preprocessing steps like normalization and train-test splitting, and training a Linear Regression model. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²), and its coefficients are analyzed to determine the impact of each feature on housing prices. Cross-validation and residual analysis ensure the model's robustness, and the trained model can be saved for future predictions. This project leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
### Objective:
The Boston Housing dataset is a classic dataset used for regression analysis, containing information about housing in the Boston area. It consists of 506 instances and 14 attributes
### key Activities:
- Data Cleaning: Check for and handle missing values or outliers.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics for each feature.
- Visualization: Use plots (scatter plots, histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to visualize the distributions and relationships of the features.
- Techonologies used:
  - python
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - sklearn
  - numpy
